## UXDI30 Microsoft Mockup
---
**Note from Anna Zocher on March 10th, 2020:**

This is a repository - it is the same thing as a folder, but on Github. Github is a third party tool that lets developers manage code. 

Click on `index.html` above to see what our code from class was.

### Current Status
By end of class today we:
* Built an HTML site with a linked, external CSS file
* Included Bootstrap 4 in our project (via CDN link)
* Wrote two rows in HTML/Bootstrap. A menu row, a call to action image row.

### Goals for Next Class:
By the end of our next class:
* Have finished our Microsoft Mockup
* Understand difference between using Bootstrap and not
* Understand how to declare a mockup in Bootstrap and htmL

***Long term aims:***
- Declare mockups in components for React developers
- Understand which modern frameworks you might be asked to design for
- What Github is and how we use it as developers/designers
